Washington, D.C. is once again facing an unnecessary and damaging federal overreach. Due to a congressional oversight, the city’s ability to spend its own locally raised tax dollars has been blocked, threatening a $1.1 billion cut to essential services like police, schools, and public safety programs. The Senate has already acted unanimously to fix this issue by passing the District of Columbia Local Funds Act of 2025, but the bill still needs approval from the House of Representatives.

This is not just a budget issue—it is a question of fairness and local control. No other city or state in America has its locally approved budget subject to congressional approval. This is a clear violation of D.C.’s right to self-governance and a stark reminder of why D.C. statehood is long overdue.

Below, you'll find two letters urging members of Congress to take immediate action—one tailored for Democrats, emphasizing civil rights and representation, and one for Republicans, highlighting limited government and local control. Please send these to your representatives today to demand they fix this mistake and respect D.C.’s autonomy.

Letter for Democrats

Subject: Defend D.C.’s Autonomy – Pass the Local Funds Act

Dear [Senator/Representative Last Name],

I am writing to express my deep concern over Congress’s continued interference in D.C.’s governance. The omission of D.C.’s budget authority in the recent continuing resolution has put the city in a dire position, threatening a $1.1 billion budget cut that will devastate public safety, education, and essential services.

D.C. has more residents than Wyoming or Vermont, yet it has no voting representation in Congress. This is not just a budget issue—it’s a civil rights issue. The District’s residents deserve full representation, and Congress should not have the power to override the decisions of a duly elected local government.

The Senate has already acted unanimously to correct this error with the District of Columbia Local Funds Act of 2025. Now, it is time for the House to do the same.

I urge you to:

Support and pass the Local Funds Act immediately to restore D.C.’s ability to use its own locally raised revenue.

Publicly oppose any attempts to use D.C. as a bargaining chip in federal budget fights.

Push for full statehood to ensure D.C. residents have equal representation and control over their own affairs.

For too long, Congress has wielded unchecked power over D.C., blocking policies its residents support and slashing its budget at will. This must end. Please act now to ensure the Local Funds Act passes without delay and to support D.C.’s long-overdue right to full representation.

Sincerely,[Your Name]

Letter to Republican

Subject: Protect Local Control – Support D.C. Budget Autonomy

Dear [Senator/Representative Last Name],

I am writing as a concerned constituent who believes in limited government, fiscal responsibility, and the right of local communities to govern themselves. The omission of D.C.’s budget authority in the continuing resolution puts at risk $1.1 billion in local tax revenue, impacting public safety, charter schools, and essential services. This situation is a clear example of federal overreach that runs counter to the principles of local autonomy.

Republicans have long championed local control—that decisions affecting communities should be made by the people who live there, not by federal lawmakers. Yet, Washington, D.C. remains uniquely subject to congressional control over its own locally raised funds. If Congress dictated how Texas or Florida could spend their tax dollars, it would be seen as an unacceptable intrusion. D.C. should be afforded the same respect for self-governance.

The District of Columbia Local Funds Act of 2025 has already passed the Senate unanimously, with bipartisan support. The House should follow suit to ensure that D.C. taxpayers’ money is used as intended—without unnecessary federal intervention.

I urge you to:

Support and pass the Local Funds Act immediately to restore D.C.’s ability to manage its budget efficiently.

Uphold the conservative principle of limited government by allowing D.C. to make fiscal decisions without federal interference.

Prevent Congress from setting a precedent where local budgets become a tool in national political debates.

A strong, well-managed capital city benefits the entire nation. Congress should focus on national priorities and allow local leaders to handle local issues—a principle that has always been central to conservative governance. I encourage you to stand for fiscal responsibility and local control by supporting this bill.

Sincerely,[Your Name]
