Half of Them Will Be Dead in Three Months

The Trump Administration quietly canceled the world’s most effective child hunger program. We must act before millions of children pay the price.

In what may become one of the most quietly devastating decisions of this administration, Trump’s government has abruptly canceled nearly all future shipments of emergency therapeutic food to starving children around the world—food that has a documented success rate of over 90% when used to treat acute malnutrition. Experts estimate that up to 3 million children were depending on these supplies. Without it, many won’t survive past the summer.

What makes this even more cruel is that the system worked. For just $40, children suffering the final stages of malnutrition—hair falling out, stomachs bloated, teeth lost, too weak to cry—could be brought back from the brink with peanut-based pouches. Three a day, over six weeks, was enough to save most lives. It’s considered one of the greatest public health breakthroughs of our time—easier to deliver than vaccines, more effective than antibiotics in emergencies.

But after briefly restoring some old orders following public pressure, the Trump administration quietly canceled all new shipments, broke contracts with manufacturers and shippers, and left hundreds of thousands of boxes to rot in warehouses in Georgia and Rhode Island. Even UNICEF and the World Food Programme, who coordinate global nutrition aid, weren’t officially informed.

This isn’t hypothetical. Experts say if these children don’t get treatment, half will die within three months. The others will likely suffer permanent cognitive and physical disabilities. Meanwhile, Save the Children has already shut down nearly 1,000 health clinics, stripped of U.S. funding.

We are the wealthiest nation on Earth. The entire program costs a fraction of the defense budget—and yet it’s being discarded while children waste away, not because of cost, but because of politics.

This is a moment of moral clarity. If nothing changes, hundreds of thousands will die before fall.

Write your representatives. Demand immediate reinstatement of emergency therapeutic food shipments and full funding for USAID’s global nutrition work. This is not a partisan issue—it’s a test of our shared humanity.

Letter for Democrats

Subject: Reinstate Emergency Nutrition Aid to Save 3 Million Children

Dear [Senator/Representative Last Name],

I’m writing to express deep concern over the Trump administration’s quiet cancellation of emergency nutrition aid for malnourished children. This decision puts up to 3 million children at immediate risk of death. Experts warn that half may die within three months without ready-to-use therapeutic foods—one of the most effective treatments ever developed.

The aid being blocked isn’t wasteful spending—it’s $40 worth of life-saving packets that are shelf-stable, parent-administered, and more than 90% effective in reversing severe malnutrition. This program, supported by both UNICEF and USAID for over a decade, was one of America’s proudest humanitarian legacies. It saved lives and strengthened our global leadership.

Instead, we are watching contracts voided, factories halted, and food stockpiles expire in warehouses—all while children go without treatment.

Please take immediate action to:

Reinstate all USAID contracts for therapeutic food with Mana and Edesia

Restore the shipping and delivery infrastructure needed to get food overseas

Fully fund nutrition programs at USAID and oppose their absorption into the State Department


We cannot let bureaucratic cruelty or political indifference extinguish a program that has saved millions. Please stand for the children whose lives depend on it.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Subject: Save 3 Million Children—A Moral Duty for a Christian Nation

Dear [Senator/Representative Last Name],

As someone who values faith, compassion, and responsible leadership, I am deeply alarmed by the quiet cancellation of the U.S. emergency food program that was saving starving children around the world. Experts estimate that up to 3 million children were depending on this aid. Without it, half could die within just three months.

As Christians, we are called to care for the “least of these.” The Book of Proverbs teaches that “he who gives to the poor will not want,” and Jesus himself said that feeding the hungry is a direct service to Him. Turning our backs on starving children goes against everything our faith demands.

This isn’t about wasteful spending. A six-week supply of fortified peanut paste—costing just $40—can save a child’s life. These packets are shelf-stable, easy to deliver, and treat even the most extreme cases of malnutrition with a 90% recovery rate. But the Trump administration has canceled new orders, failed to renew shipping contracts, and defunded the very clinics that distribute this aid.

We cannot let these decisions stand. I respectfully urge you to:

Restore funding and contracts for emergency food programs through USAID

Ensure that shipments reach children in need in countries like Somalia, Bangladesh, and Yemen

Speak up for the Christian values of mercy, generosity, and the defense of the vulnerable


This is not about politics. It is about children. About life and death. About what kind of country we want to be.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
