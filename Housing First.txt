In recent years, one approach has consistently shown success in reducing homelessness—Housing First. This model, once backed by presidents from both parties, puts people in housing without requiring treatment or sobriety first. That’s not permissive; it’s pragmatic. As former HUD Secretary Ben Carson put it, there’s “a mountain of data” showing that Housing First works.

The results speak for themselves. Since 2009, homelessness among veterans has fallen by over 55%, thanks largely to Housing First policies. In Washington, D.C., overall homelessness dropped by 39% in 2023—including a 73% reduction in family homelessness—driven by rapid housing placements and coordinated efforts that prioritize stable shelter first.

What’s at risk now is not just a policy, but a system that works. The U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, which helps local leaders streamline federal tools and cut red tape - all with a paltry 4 million dollar budget - is being dismantled. That same council helped cities like D.C. unlock federal waivers and make rental assistance more flexible—getting people off the streets faster by using presumptive eligibility, which allows people to move in before they’ve finished gathering paperwork.

Housing First doesn’t ignore addiction or mental health—it gives people a fighting chance to face those challenges once they’re safely housed. It saves lives, cuts public costs, and restores dignity.

We cannot afford to abandon what works—especially for our veterans. Write your representatives today. Demand they defend Housing First, protect the Interagency Council, and keep the focus on proven results, not politics. Veterans and families are counting on it.

Letter for Democrats

Subject: Defend Proven Policy – Protect Housing First and the USICH

Dear [Senator/Representative Last Name],

I’m writing to urge you to stand up for Housing First and protect the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH). These programs are not theoretical—they have reduced veteran homelessness by over 55% and saved countless lives.

Housing First works because it treats housing as a foundation, not a reward. It doesn’t ignore treatment—it makes treatment more effective by providing safety and stability first. The approach has been endorsed by leaders across the political spectrum, including former HUD Secretary Ben Carson, who cited “a mountain of data” in its favor.

Efforts to dismantle the USICH and gut Housing First from federal funding threaten a decades-long bipartisan success. I urge you to:

Defend Housing First as a core pillar of federal homelessness policy.

Support the continued operation of the USICH and its role in promoting efficient, coordinated action.

Resist attempts to add barriers like treatment requirements before housing access.

We cannot allow ideology to override evidence. Housing First works—and it must remain at the center of efforts to end homelessness.



Sincerely,

[Your Name]

Letter for Republicans

Subject: A Common-Sense Approach – Support Housing First and Government Efficiency


Dear [Senator/Representative Last Name],

As someone who values efficiency, personal responsibility, and results-driven policy, I’m asking you to protect one of the most effective, bipartisan tools in federal homelessness efforts: Housing First.

The Housing First model, backed by both Republican and Democratic administrations, gives people a chance to stabilize before addressing treatment needs. It reduces repeat hospital visits, criminal justice costs, and emergency services use. It’s a conservative success story in government efficiency, and it works without expanding bureaucracy.

Even former HUD Secretary Ben Carson praised the approach, citing “a mountain of data” that proves its value. Since 2009, veteran homelessness has dropped more than 55%, thanks largely to this model. And with tools like presumptive eligibility, we cut red tape and get people into housing faster—something every taxpayer should support.

I urge you to:

Protect the Housing First approach in federal policy and grant funding.

Support continued coordination through the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness.

Back reforms that reduce bureaucracy while increasing access to proven solutions.


Housing First is not about ideology—it’s about what works. Let’s keep politics out of it and stick with the facts.



Sincerely,

[Your Name]
