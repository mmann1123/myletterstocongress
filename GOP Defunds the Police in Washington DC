All,

We are at a critical moment where the autonomy of Washington, D.C. is under direct threat. Washington DC pays for it’s budget from local revenues, maintains a balanced budget, and has succeeded in creating a livable, safe, and thriving city.  The stopgap spending bill being pushed through Congress would effectively slash D.C.’s budget by $1 billion over six months, forcing dramatic cuts to essential services - like the police. This is not just a routine budget fight—this is an attempt to override D.C.’s self-governance and keep its residents under the thumb of federal politicians.

"No taxation without representation." This founding principle of American democracy remains unfulfilled for the 700,000 residents of D.C., who pay federal taxes, serve in the military, and fulfill all the obligations of citizenship—yet have no voting representation in Congress. If D.C. were a state, this reckless budget maneuver would be impossible. Instead, D.C. remains uniquely vulnerable to political interference.

This is a crisis, but we can act. Write to your representatives today using https://democracy.io/ to demand they respect D.C.'s right to govern itself. Forward this email to friends, family, and colleagues who care about protecting democracy and local control.

Letter for Democrats

Subject: Defend D.C.’s Autonomy – Support Statehood

Dear [Senator/Representative Last Name],

I am writing to express my deep concern over Congress’s continued interference in D.C.’s governance. The latest spending bill, which strips D.C. of $1 billion in local funds, highlights the urgent need for statehood. For over 50 years, Congress has maintained final control over D.C.’s budget and laws, overriding local decisions and treating its residents as second-class citizens.

D.C. has more residents than Wyoming or Vermont, yet it has no voting representation in Congress. This is not just a budget issue—it’s a civil rights issue. The District’s predominantly Black and brown residents deserve full representation, and Congress should not have the power to override the decisions of a duly elected local government.

I urge you to:
- Publicly support D.C. statehood and push back against budget cuts that undermine its autonomy.
- Introduce or co-sponsor legislation that grants D.C. the same rights as any other state.
- Oppose any efforts to use D.C. as a bargaining chip in federal budget fights.

For too long, Congress has wielded unchecked power over D.C., blocking policies its residents support and slashing its budget at will. This must end. Please act now to support D.C. statehood and full representation for its citizens.

Sincerely,[your name]

Letter for Republicans

Subject: Preserve Local Control – End Federal Overreach in D.C.

Dear [Senator/Representative Last Name],

I am writing as a concerned constituent who believes in limited government, local self-rule, and fiscal responsibility—principles that are being ignored in the latest congressional attack on D.C. The spending bill’s $1 billion cut to D.C.’s budget is a clear example of federal overreach, forcing local taxpayers to bear the cost of political games in Washington.

Moreover, defunding the police and charter schools is a bad look for Republicans

Republicans have long supported the idea that local communities—not the federal government—should control their own affairs. Yet Congress continues to micromanage D.C., overriding its budget and laws in ways that no other jurisdiction in the country faces. Imagine if Congress dictated how Texas or Florida could spend their local tax dollars. Would that be acceptable? If not, why should D.C. be different?

I urge you to:
- Defend the principle of local self-governance by supporting D.C.’s right to control its own budget.
- Oppose efforts to use the D.C. budget as leverage in unrelated federal policy battles.
- Support legislation that permanently grants D.C. the same budgetary independence as the states.

Conservatives should stand against unnecessary federal interference, no matter the political context. Congress should not be in the business of micromanaging city governments. I urge you to stand for limited government and support D.C.’s right to govern itself.

Sincerely,[your name]
