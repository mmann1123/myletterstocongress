All,

We are at a critical moment where the foundations of our democratic system are being tested. Recent actions—including freezing spending, overriding constitutional amendments (birthright citizenship), co-opting the power of the purse in the executive branch, canceling contracts, closing congressionally mandated agencies, and firing inspectors general to prevent them upholding the law—highlight a dangerous erosion of accountability and push us towards the precipice of a constitutional crisis.

"Ambition must be made to counteract ambition." - James Madison This principle, embodied in our system of checks and balances, is what separates us from authoritarian regimes like Russia and North Korea. Ignoring these safeguards comes at a cost - read up on how Hugo Chavez turned Venezuela from a democracy to autocracy. Congress and the judiciary must defend their powers granted by the constitution for us to remain a democracy.

If you are a Republican

One critical point I think is going unnoticed: How will these newfound, seemingly endless powers be used to reshape America when a Democrat holds the White House with 51.5% of the vote? If Congress allows a president to fire inspectors general without cause, withhold congressionally approved funding, and override legal precedents with the stroke of a pen, those same powers will be available to the next administration—no matter their party. I am just spit-balling here, a few to consider: term limits for the Supreme Court, Medicaid for All, statehood for Washington DC & Puerto Rico, and replacing the electoral college with the popular vote. Hopefully we can agree a unitary executive is a bad deal for all Americans.

This is a crisis, but we can act. Write to your representatives today using https://democracy.io to demand they uphold the laws and norms of American democracy. Forward this email to friends, family, and colleagues who care about preserving our democratic institutions.


Here’s a draft email you can send to your members of Congress:

Letter for Democrats

Subject: Defend Our Democracy – Uphold Checks & Balances

Dear [Senator/Representative Last Name],

I am writing to express my deep concern over the unprecedented expansion of executive power under President Trump, which threatens the constitutional balance between the branches of government. Firing inspectors general without cause, withholding congressionally approved funding, overriding constitutional amendments, and eliminating independent oversight are all actions that violate the rule of law and set a dangerous precedent.

These are not just isolated events—they are part of a broader pattern of dismantling accountability and consolidating unchecked power within the executive branch. If Congress does not act, these abuses will become the norm, regardless of who holds the presidency. What happens when a future administration, of either party, uses these same powers to push through policies with no legislative oversight?

As a member of Congress, you must use every available tool to defend our democracy. I urge you to:
- Publicly denounce these abuses and call for investigations into these illegal firings and spending freezes.
- Introduce and support legislation that limits executive overreach and strengthens congressional authority over federal funds.
- Block and resist any further attempts by this administration to erode oversight.

Democracy does not defend itself—it requires leaders who are willing to hold the line and push back against authoritarianism, no matter how gradual or insidious its encroachment. Please act before it is too late.

Sincerely,

[your name]

Letter for Republicans

Subject: Preserve Constitutional Checks & Balances – A Conservative Imperative

Dear [Senator/Representative Last Name],

I am writing as a concerned constituent who believes in limited government, separation of powers, and the rule of law—principles that are now under direct threat. President Trump’s unprecedented expansion of executive power, including firing inspectors general without cause, freezing congressionally approved spending, overriding constitutional amendments, and eliminating independent oversight, is setting a dangerous precedent that could be turned against Republicans in the future.

Unchecked power may serve a short-term partisan advantage, but history has shown that the same weapons will be used by the opposition once they gain control. Imagine a Democratic president:

Mandating Medicare for All with an sweeping executive order

Withholding congressionally approved defense funding based on personal policy preferences.

Unilaterally ending the filibuster, expanding the Supreme Court, or replacing the electoral college—all by executive order.

This is not a question of party loyalty—it is a question of whether Congress remains a co-equal branch of government or allows the executive branch to seize unilateral control. If you remain silent now, future presidents—from the left or the right—will exploit this same unchecked authority.

I urge you to:
- Publicly affirm Congress’s constitutional authority and denounce these executive overreaches.
- Defend congressional power over spending—no president should be able to bypass the power of the purse.
- Push for legislation that ensures permanent checks on executive authority, protecting conservative values of limited government for future generations.

Republican leadership should recognize that safeguarding checks and balances is not about opposing a single president—it’s about protecting the very foundation of American democracy. I urge you to stand up now before it’s too late.

Sincerely,

[your name]
