All,

We are at a critical moment where the foundations of American scientific progress are under direct attack. Science—our best tool for understanding the world, improving public health, and driving innovation—is being undermined by budget cuts, political interference, and a blatant disregard for evidence-based decision-making. The latest round of funding cuts to federal research agencies, the suppression of public health data, and the dismissal of scientific experts are not just policy decisions—they are an assault on the very engine of American progress. "Facts are stubborn things." John Adams’ words remind us that reality does not bend to political convenience. Yet, scientists across the country are facing censorship, funding is being slashed for essential research, and federal agencies are being forced to silence their experts. These actions will have lasting consequences, from delayed medical breakthroughs to weakened environmental protections.

Discoveries Often Sound Ridiculous—Until They Change the World

Much of the world-changing science we rely on today started in ways that seemed, at first, impractical or even absurd. Some of the most profitable drugs in history—Ozempic and Wegovy—originated from research into the saliva of the Gila monster. LASIK eye surgery, which has restored vision for millions, was discovered after a graduate student accidentally hit his own eye with a laser. The Golden Goose Award highlights countless other examples of curiosity-driven science that led to breakthroughs in medicine, technology, and industry.

Cutting science funding today doesn’t just halt current projects—it kills the unpredictable, world-changing discoveries of tomorrow. If past administrations had slashed research funding as recklessly as today’s politicians, we might not have the internet, GPS, or life-saving vaccines.

This is a crisis, but we can act. Write to your representatives today using https://democracy.io/ to demand they protect scientific integrity and restore funding for critical research. Forward this email to friends, family, and colleagues who care about protecting science from political interference.

Letter for Democrats

Subject: Protect Science – Defend Evidence-Based Policy

Dear [Senator/Representative Last Name],

I am writing to express my deep concern over the growing political attacks on science and research. From suppressing climate data to slashing funding for public health initiatives, these actions threaten not just our scientific institutions but the well-being of every American. Science is not a partisan issue—it is the foundation of innovation, economic growth, and public safety.

The latest budget proposals would gut funding for agencies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), jeopardizing life-saving medical research, environmental protections, and technological advancements that keep America competitive. Meanwhile, federal scientists are being silenced, unable to share vital research with the public or collaborate with international experts.

I urge you to:
- Restore full funding for federal science agencies to ensure continued research in public health, energy, and environmental science.
- Pass legislation that protects scientific integrity and prevents political interference in research.
- Support policies that ensure government scientists can communicate their findings without fear of retaliation.
- The strength of our nation depends on facts, not political convenience. I urge you to take action to defend scientific integrity and restore funding for critical research.

Sincerely,[your name]

Letter for Republicans

Subject: Defend Innovation – Stop Political Attacks on Science

Dear [Senator/Representative Last Name],

I am writing as a concerned citizen who values American innovation, economic growth, and technological leadership—principles that are being undermined by the recent attacks on science. The U.S. has long been a global leader in medical research, engineering, and technological advancement, but cutting federal science funding and silencing experts threaten our ability to compete on the world stage.

Republicans have long championed economic growth and national security, both of which depend on strong investment in research and development. Imagine if we had defunded space exploration before the moon landing, or if we had politicized vaccine research during the fight against polio. The same mistakes are being repeated today, with disastrous consequences for our economy and national security.

I urge you to:

- Defend America’s leadership in science and technology by protecting research funding for agencies like NIH, NSF, and the Department of Energy.
- Ensure government scientists can work without political interference, allowing them to contribute to national security, economic policy, and technological innovation.
- Push back against efforts to use science funding as a political bargaining chip, ensuring long-term stability for American research institutions.
- Science fuels American ingenuity, drives job growth, and keeps our nation safe. Congress must act now to protect it.

Sincerely,[your name]

Science is not a partisan issue—it’s an American issue. Let’s make sure our leaders hear us.
